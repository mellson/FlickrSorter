FlickrSorter
============
!!! Very early work, use on own risk !!!

Scala tool to help sort your Flickr photostream according to the date of the photos.

This is a very early prototype that I have used to sort my own Flickr photostream.
You should be able to insert your own keys in FlickrKeys and use it yourself.

Hopefully I will get time to update the code in the future.
If you want to use it and have questions, please just write me.
