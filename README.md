FlickrSorter
============
!!! Very early work, use on own risk !!!

Scala tool to help sort your Flickr photostream according to the date of the photos.

This is a very early prototype that I have used to sort my own Flickr photostream.
You should be able to insert your own keys in FlickrKeys.scala and use it yourself.

Your own FlickrKeys.scala should have a structure like so:

```scala
object FlickrKeys {
  val apikey = ""
  val secret = ""

  val authtoken = ""
  val userid = ""
}
```

Hopefully I will get time to update the code in the future.
If you want to use it and have questions, please just write me.
